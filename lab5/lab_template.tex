\begin{abstract}

\noindent This lab builds on programming cyber-physical systems, specifically feedback-control. Using Microsoft Visual Studio Express, we implemented a state machine in C that instructs the iRobot Create to navigate to the top of an incline while avoiding cliffs and obstacles in a simulated environment. Then using C \& C++ Development Tools for NI Linux Real-Time, Eclipse Edition, we implemented a state machine in C on myRIO that instructs the iRobot Create to navigate to the top of an incline while avoiding cliffs and obstacles in a real physical environment.

\section{Hill Climb in Simulation}
For the hill climb simulation we programmed the virtual robot in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013a. It was in the simulator that we designed the states for the robot to follow. The states can be seen in the image above. I did however exclude the logic and paths to the pause state for readability.\\

\noindent The code for the hill climb was broken down into a few separate areas: an area for declarations, an area for calculations and resets, an area for pause state transitions, an area for run state transitions, and an area for state actions. Most of the logic we programmed was in the drive state. This allowed us to program for cliffs and obstacles and to transition from drive when such things were encountered and to transition back to drive so that the robot would be ready when such conditions occurred again.\\

\vspace{5mm}
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, frame=single]
case DRIVE:
		if (downclineState && abs(accel.y) <= 0.08 && abs(accel.z) >= 0.99 && abs(accel.x) <= 0.08 && (abs(netDistance - distanceAtDownclineStart) >= downclineDistanceThreshold)) {
			state = UNPAUSE_WAIT_BUTTON_PRESS;
		} else if (sensors.cliffFrontLeft || sensors.cliffFrontRight) {
			//state = DOWNCLINE;
			state = BACKUP_RIGHT;
			downclineState = true;
			distanceAtDownclineStart = netDistance;
		} else if (sensors.cliffLeft) {
			turnAmount = 25;
			state = RIGHT_TURN;
		} else if (sensors.cliffRight) {
			turnAmount = 25;
			state = LEFT_TURN;
		} else if (((((accel.x > xAccelInclineThreshold || accel.x < -xAccelInclineThreshold) || (accel.y > yAccelInclineThreshold || accel.y < -yAccelInclineThreshold) ) && accel.z < zAccelInclineThreshold ) && !first_incline_set) && !(sensors.bumps_wheelDrops.bumpLeft || sensors.bumps_wheelDrops.bumpRight || downclineState)) {
			state = UPINCLINE;
		} else if (sensors.bumps_wheelDrops.bumpLeft) {
            state = BACKUP_RIGHT;
			turnAmount = bumpTurnAmount;
            distanceAtManeuverStart = netDistance;
        } else if (sensors.bumps_wheelDrops.bumpRight) {
            state = BACKUP_LEFT;
			turnAmount = bumpTurnAmount;
            distanceAtManeuverStart = netDistance;
        } else {
            if (((netAngle - desiredAngle) < -5) && (abs(netDistance - distanceAtManeuverStart) >= 150)){
                state = LEFT_TURN;
				turnAmount = abs(netAngle - desiredAngle);
            }
            if (((netAngle - desiredAngle) > 5) && (abs(netDistance - distanceAtManeuverStart) >= 150)){
                state = RIGHT_TURN;
				turnAmount = abs(netAngle - desiredAngle);
            }
        }
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent We used feedback from the accelerometer to differentiate between states like drive and incline. We decided to go for the simple approach and try isolating values for the x, y, z accelerometers to determine if the iRobot was on an incline. We found for the simulation this worked rather well with certain thresholds set. 

\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, frame=single]
static double zAccelInclineThreshold = 1;
static double yAccelInclineThreshold = 0.1;
static double xAccelInclineThreshold = 0.1;
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Now then that we knew we were on an incline, we needed to adjust to point directly up the incline. To do this we first we stopped our forward motion to get a more accurate reading on the accelerometers. Then we wanted to detect if we're pointing upward or downward on the incline. If we're pointing downward, first thing we do is turn around 180 degrees to point up the incline. The state then will loop and we then set the initial incline y accelerometer reading. We then turn either right or left depending on if the original incline by 3 degrees at a time, until it reaches the opposite sign. This then we set for our desired angle and we transition to the drive state. From there, if we continue to be on an incline, we recheck our incline every 500mm. We decided to use a low pass averaging filter. However we felt it was unecessary as this part of our algorithm seemed to be working pretty robustly before we introduced the filtering.

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, frame=single]
// lets filter the accelerometer
    medianX = (1 - FILTER_WEIGHT) * medianX + (FILTER_WEIGHT) * accel.x;
    medianY = (1 - FILTER_WEIGHT) * medianY + (FILTER_WEIGHT) * accel.y;
    medianZ = (1 - FILTER_WEIGHT) * medianZ + (FILTER_WEIGHT) * accel.z;
\end{lstlisting}

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, frame=single]
case UPINCLINE: 
		if (accel.x < -0.15) {
			desiredAngle = netAngle + 180;
			turnAmount = 180;
			state = RIGHT_TURN;
		} else if (incline_start_angle < 0 && accel.y < 0) {
			turnAmount = 1;
			state = RIGHT_TURN;
		} else if ((incline_start_angle > 0 && accel.y > 0)) {
			turnAmount = 1;
			state = LEFT_TURN;
		} else {
			first_incline_set = true;
			desiredAngle = netAngle;
			state = DRIVE;
		}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Initial testing on CyberSim allowed us to catch many errors quickly and to calibrate many of our thresholds, especially those for detecting inclines. We chose to keep multiple drive speeds, faster for flat, slower for incline, as this allowed us to pass the CyberSim simulations consistently. Going slower on inclines allowed in the simulation for more accurate accelerometer readings and also kept us from going over the edge.\\

\section{Hill Climb on iRobot}

We found right away that the simulator was quite different from the real world implementation. When we first uploaded our code the the iRobot, it ran in circles. We found out that (some) of the iRobots have the wheels wired opposite. So when you tell the machine to turn right, it turns left and vice versa. So we reversed the wheel direction in our code. Then to trouble shoot we decided to log the states into a file on the iRobot. To do that we used the code below. This allowed us to diagnose and troubleshoot the issues we had with the machine much more efficently and accurately.

\vspace{6mm}
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, frame=single]
FILE *fp = fopen("statehistory.txt", "a");
fprintf(fp, "instrument readings");
fclose (fp);
\end{lstlisting}

One of the issues we had with the physical machine was that its accelerometer readings were much more sporadic. This led us to adjusting the thresholds for the accelerometer for the incline settings for better performance. I also tried making a queue of accelerometer measurements and taking a median of the values to throw away outliers. This however, while great in principal, didn't seem to work on the machine, as it slowed the acquisition of the incline state down a bit. Perhaps this would be a good technique to retry in the future when there is more time to test.

\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, frame=single]
static double zAccelInclineThreshold = 0.97;
static double yAccelInclineThreshold = 0.14;
static double xAccelInclineThreshold = 0.14;
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent We also had to increase the incline drive speed, as the iRobot would often get stuck at the beginning of the ramp incline. With those set, then we had to adjust the settings for when we detect the cliff at the end, so the iRobot would reverse for a short distance, or we found that it would often drop a wheel off the side while turning around. We found that we had to include some "corrections" in our code for the physical iRobot in comparision to the simulation. For example we uncorrected an over correction for the angle up an incline. And we also had to adjust from turning around 180 degrees to 170 degrees as we found that is what actually turned the machine around for reverse downward the ramp.

\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, frame=single]
 else if (inclineCorrection){
            inclineCorrection = false;
            turnAmount = 5;
            if (incline_start_angle < 0) {
                state = LEFT_TURN;
            }
            else {
                state = RIGHT_TURN;
            }
        }
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Feedback}

We found this lab to be a lot of work. We spent not only our lab time, but much of Friday, Saturday, Monday, and Wednesday on this lab to get everything correct. One thing we learned is to try and find a good trouble shooting tool. This for us on this project was logging states and sensor readings on the iRobot. Beyond that, I would recommend in the future that maybe this lab be paced out to be over two weeks. I think this would relieve much of the pressure on students, and would allow more time for experimentation with the iRobot. I have a few ideas that I believe would lead to a better implementation but unfortunately don't have the time to try them out. And it's the trying it out that in the end leads to learning.
